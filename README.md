# Pacman
Pacman Project in 6 Parts:
Part 1: Students implement depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.
Part 2: Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. Students implement multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.
Part 3: Pacman uses logical inference to solve planning tasks as well as localization, mapping, and SLAM.
Part 4: Pacman uses probabilistic inference on Bayes Nets to calculate expected returns to find food in the dark.
Part 5: Students implement the perceptron algorithm and neural network models, and apply the models to several tasks including digit classification.
Part 6: Students implement Value Function, Q learning, Approximate Q learning, and a Deep Q Network to help pacman and crawler agents learn rational policies.
